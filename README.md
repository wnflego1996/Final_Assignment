《Illusory Dharma and Conscious Observation》。 The inspiration for this work comes from the statement in the Buddhist "Diamond Sutra": "All conditioned phenomena are like a dream, an illusion, a bubble, a shadow, like dew and like lightning. 
One should view them thus." It embodies the Buddhist concepts of emptiness and impermanence, revealing that all worldly phenomena are born of the combination of causes and conditions, are illusory and unreal in essence, and change rapidly. 
It exhorts people to break free from their attachment to the appearance of things and to perceive and interact with the world from the perspective of understanding their empty and impermanent natures, thereby achieving inner detachment and getting rid of the shackles of troubles.

This work was mainly constructed using TouchDesigner (TD) technology. Specifically, Python crawler technology was employed to capture the text uploaded to Google Sheet and transmit it into TD.
